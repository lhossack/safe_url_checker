It is recommended to install dependencies in a virtual environment.

### Using virtual environments

To initialize a virtualenv on a *nix based OS:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After venv initialization, activate your venv using:

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows, activate venv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

To install required dependencies, run this command:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To add additional dependencies, add them to the `setup.py` file and 
rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.
